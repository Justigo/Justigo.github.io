            Hitori is my number 1 BEST_GIRL! She's expressive, bold, childish, blunt, and determined.
            These characteristics help form her into the perfect jealous psychopath... In the manga, she's characterized as the 3rd wheel + 
            childhood friend that's trying to steal back the boyfriend. She's basically set up for up to fail. However, as the TRUE heroine she is, 
            Hitori takes the neceesarry steps, mostly malicious steps, in order to destroy that Adachi-loser and upgrade from a supporting role. I 
            don't think anything Hitori did was very ethical nor moral, but because of the way she approached the situation and expressed herself, 
            it felt very HONEST. :)
